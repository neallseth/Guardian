# Guardian

MacOS-native screen time monitoring for eye health. 

Apple's screen time tools lack essential features, and third-party tools were far too bloated for my liking. I chose to build a simple, memory-efficient, and open-source utility to solve my problem.

## What it does
Guardian has a minimal presence in your menu bar (far left in the below screenshot).

It offers a simple indicator of elapsed screen time since your last break (tracking begins when you unlock your computer, open the lid, etc.)

It also offers notifications, alerting you after a chosen length of continuous screen use.

## Efficiency

Guardian has a tiny memory footprint of ~15MB. For reference, comparable utilities clock in around 60MB. Larger apps, like Slack, are closer to 300MB.

Even the most memory-constrained environments should be able to comfortably run Guardian all day long.
