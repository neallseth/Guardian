# Guardian

MacOS-native screen time monitoring for eye health. 

Apple's screen time tools lack essential features, and third-party tools were bloated and inefficient. So I built a minimal, memory-efficient, and open-source version that solved my problem.

## What it does
Guardian has a minimal presence in your menu bar.

It offers a simple indicator of elapsed screen time since your last break (when you unlock your computer, open the lid, etc.)

It also offers notifications, alerting you after a chosen length of continuous screen use.

## Efficiency

Guardian has a tiny memory footprint - usually < 20MB. This is 50-60% lower memory utilization compared to similar tools.
