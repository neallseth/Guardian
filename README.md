# Guardian

MacOS-native screen time monitoring for eye health. Apple's version was lacking necessary features, and other tools were bloated and inefficient. So I built a minimal, memory-efficient, and open-source version that solved my problem.

Guardian lives in your menu bar, and will alert you of excessive continuous usage at your preferred time (e.g. 30 minutes). Locking your computer represents a "break" - the timer restarts once you unlock.
